Not fighting frantically for your life is all right, too.
The time when you're happy is also the time when you're afraid that the happiness will end.
A lesson without pain is meaningless. For you cannot gain something without sacrificing something else in return. But once you have recovered it and made it your own... You will gain an irreplaceable Fullmetal heart
All we can do is live until the day we die. Control what we can...and fly free
Saru, you must protect those who have faith in you and who love the village, and train up to those to whom you can entrust the next generation… from tomorrow, you will be the Hokage…!
People’s lives don’t end when they die. It ends when they lose faith
It is only through the eyes of others that our lives have any meaning
Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions. Everyone lives within their own subjective interpretation
People who continue to put their lives on the line to defend their faith become heroes and continue to exist on in legend
Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because… No matter how pathetic the reason, it’s enough to start war. War will never cease to exist… reasons can be thought up after the fact… Human nature pursues strife
Rejection is a part of any man’s life. If you can’t accept and move past rejection, or at least use it as writing material – you’re not a real man
In this world, wherever there is light – there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love
Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing… that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don’t you see? It’s an empty existence, to go on living… alone and unloved… when defeat’s already cost you your dream!
It’s not the face that makes someone a monster, it’s the choices they make with their lives
1While you’re alive, you need a reason for your existence. Being unable to find one is the same as being dead
Maybe, just maybe, there is no purpose in life… but if you linger a while longer in this world, you might discover something of value in it
Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality only pain, suffering and futility exist
